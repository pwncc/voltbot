<h1 align="center">Mira - LLM Chatbot</h1>

Another Discord-based LLM chatbot.

## Features
- RAG-based knowledge, useful for server rules, faq, lore
- Reply chain conversation history
- Image input
- Basic web search (searxng)

## Usage
To start a new thread, mention the bot with a prompt. Reply to the bot to continue the conversation, or ping it again to start a new thread. Replying to another user's message and pinging the bot will insert the replied-to message into the conversation.

```yaml
User: @Mira what time is it in Amsterdam
Bot: It's 5:14PM in Amsterdam right now.
User: What about in San Francisco?
Bot: It's 8:14AM in San Francisco.
```

## Tools
The bot includes a handful of tools that the language models can call:

- `search_web({query: string})`
- `get_current_time({timezone: string})`
- `fetch_discord_message({channelID: string, messsageID: string})`
- `query_server_knowledge({query: string})`

## Message Format and Contextual Data
User messages sent to the LLM are in the format `[Username: "benricheson101", Nickname: "ben"]: content`. This enables the language model to differentiate between multiple users in the same thread. The bot cannot access messages outside of its reply chain. The only exception to this is through the use of the `fetch_discord_message` tool, which lets the LLM access an outside message by its Discord ID (e.g., a user links to a message and asks for its content).

Some basic contextual info is included in each thread:
```md
## Environment Context
- Your username: {{BOT_USERNAME}},
- Server name: {{SERVER_NAME}}
- Channel name: {{CHANNEL_NAME}}
- Channel description: {{CHANNEL_DESCRIPTION}}
- Model: {{MODEL}}
```

### Web Search
Web search is provided by SearXNG. Because it's not a web scraper, it only returns limited information and not full page content. In my testing this is often sufficient for simple queries, but doesn't hold up when extensive research is required.

# Running It
```sh
$ pnpm build
$ DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./db/mira.sqlite3 dbmate up
$ pnpm mira:update-rag
$ pnpm mira:start
```

### With Docker
```sh
$ docker compose up -d searxng
$ docker compose run --rm mira mira:update-rag
$ docker compose up -d
```
